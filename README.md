# CLI Kitty

- A cool kitty that lives in your CLI! You gotta feed it, play with, and take care of it when it's sick!

## Awesome Features

- You get to choose from four cats and give it a name!
- Kitty has stats (health, happiness, hunger, and sleep) and you gotta take care of kitty according to them!
- Two cool minigames (it's literally just rock paper scissors and hangman) and you can play them whenever! (Other functions only work when kitty is low on stats)
- You get to feed kitty out of four options! One is mysterious. You will never know what she ate.
- Heal kitty when she's ill!
- Put kitty to sleep (for 15 seconds) to recharge her! Also increases her happiness if it's not full.

## To-Do
- Feral kitty, mayhaps?
- Saving so it doesn't restart everytime you play it
